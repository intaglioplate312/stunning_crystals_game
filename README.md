## Crystal Collector, 
is a fun and jQuery game.

  * The player will be shown a random number between 19 - 120, at the start of the game.
  * There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount  of points between 1 - 12, to the player's total score.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

   * When the game begins again, the player sees a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
